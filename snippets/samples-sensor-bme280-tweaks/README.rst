Overview
********

Unfortunately, the example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`bme280` from the Zephyr
upstream repository binds such a sensor hard to the SPI bus regardless of board
and shield variations, although the |zephyr:board:rpi_pico| board has no such
sensor available. Thus, no matter what you try to change via shields, a BME280
sensor is always defined and activated on the SPI bus as soon as the board name
is set to :code:`rpi_pico`.

This tweak snippet now always deletes such an entry and should only be used
exclusively for the standard :zephyr:code-sample:`bme280` sample from Zephyr.

Board specific setups
=====================

Only selected boards are supported by this snippet. There is no basic
configuration.

Supported boards are:

* |zephyr:board:rpi_pico|
