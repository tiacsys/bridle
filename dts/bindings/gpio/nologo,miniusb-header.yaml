    GPIO pins exposed on No Name Technology Mini USB RP2040/RP2350 headers.

    The Mini USB RP2040/RP2350 layout provides a wraparound header on the
    longer freely accessible edges of the board and can be divided into
    two sections, two headers on the longer opposite sides.

    Proceeding counterclockwise:
    * A 9-pin header. 9 pins on this header are exposed by this binding.
    * A 9-pin header. 6 pins on this header are exposed by this binding.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 15 pins where parent pins 11
    through 14 correspond to ADC0 through ADC3, and parent pins 0 through 14
    correspond as depicted below:
