Tests
#####

|BRIDLE| provides unit and integration tests for some of its drivers,
libraries, and APIs to help you verify their functionality.
You can find them in the ``tests`` folder.

The tests are based on Zephyr Test Framework (Ztest). For detailed
information on how to run them, see :zephyr:ref:`test-framework`.

.. note::

   This documentation covers only a few selected unit or integration tests.
