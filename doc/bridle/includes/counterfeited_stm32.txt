   `STM32F103C8T6 - Counterfeit confirmed by ST`_

|nbsp|

   .. container:: notranslate

      For several years now, the **market has been flooded with counterfeit
      STM32F103 chips**. The **C8T6** and **CBT6** variants (*LQFP48*) with
      48 pins are the most affected. The counterfeits, usually relabeled as
      STM32, often contain an:

      * **APM32F103**

.. rubric:: The following defects have been reported:
.. rst-class:: rst-columns

* DMA controller hangs.
* DMA controller triggers wrong interrupts.
* OCN outputs of the timers do not work (affects PWM).
* :brd:`Timer 5 is missing.`
* :brd:`I²C does not work.`
* :brd:`USB does not work.`
* :brd:`Debugging does not work.`
* Flashing only works via SWD, only via UART, or only at 115200 baud.
* The chip ID can be read via firmware and mostly wrong or invalid
  (this is not possible with the original).

The defects mentioned only occur partially (never all together). The major
problem is that you don't know which ones you are being sold.
