Change log
**********

* When ``getopt()`` is active (``CONFIG_SHELL_GETOPT=y``), the Zephyr shell
  is not parsing command handler to print help message. It must be done
  explicitly inside the command implementation.
* Update GPIO to use ``DT_HAS_<compat>_ENABLED`` Kconfig symbol to expose the
  driver and enable it by default based on devicetree.
* Use *Board extensions* to extended Zephyr upstream board configurations.
  In some situations, certain hardware description or choices can not be added
  in the upstream Zephyr repository, but they can be in a downstream project,
  where custom bindings or driver classes can also be created. This feature may
  also be useful in development phases, when the board skeleton lives upstream,
  but other features are developed in a downstream module. Thus the extensions
  spinned around in different shields or snippets were centraliced as board
  extensions, e.g. the special *Raspberry Pi Pico R3 edge connector binding*.
* Remove special board extensions for Nucleo F303RE/F401RE, NXP MIMXRT1010-EVK,
  and RPi Pico from the *Grove Interconnect Shield*.
* Convert all RP2040 based boards to the new *Clock Controller* support.
* Adds the new DTS binding *pwm-buzzers*, which can be used in the same way as
  the Zephyr upstream binding *pwm-leds*; but here for simple buzzers, each
  used by a dedicated PWM channel to output simple digital sounds. A simple
  buzzer sample is now also part of Bridle. This can be used for simple music
  playback via PWM.
* Adds the new DTS binding *pwm-servos* to combine several PWM channels in one
  node and make different numbers of servomotors known via alias entries. As
  long as there is no stable servo motor or motion API in Zephyr or Bridle,
  this binding will remain in flux and will not be finished.
* Add the new *PWM Servomotor Preset Snippet (pwm-servo)* for quite board
  specific preperations of the standard Zephyr Servomotor sample. Add support
  for the following boards:

  * Cytron Maker Pi RP2040

* Add more boards to the *USB Console Snippet (usb-console)*:

  * Cytron Maker Nano RP2040
  * Cytron Maker Pi RP2040
  * NXP MIMXRT1010-EVK
  * NXP MIMXRT1060-EVK
  * Raspberry Pi Pico (W)
  * Waveshare RP2040-Geek

* Add more shields:

  * *Raspberry Pi Pico Clock Shields*:

    * **Pico Clock Green** shield by Waveshare

  * *Raspberry Pi Pico LCD Shields*:

    * **Pico LCD 1.14** shield by Waveshare
    * **Pico LCD 2** shield by Waveshare
    * **Pico ResTouch LCD 3.5** shield by Waveshare

  * *Raspberry Pi Pico LED Shields*:

    * **Pico RGB LED** shield by Waveshare

  * *Raspberry Pi Pico TEST Shields*:

    * **Pico ALL GPIO TEST** shield by Spotpear

  * *Waveshare LCD Modules*:

    * **2.4inch LCD Module** as shield by Waveshare

  * Sensor shields:

    * **Pico 10-DOF IMU Sensor** shield by Waveshare
    * **Pico Environment Sensor** shield by Waveshare

* New Zephyr module: support u-blox portable C API **ubxlib** with GNSS sample.

  The GNSS sample, ``ubx_gnss`` was qualified to run on the following boards:

  * Nordic nRF9160 DK (nRF9160)
  * Nordic nRF52840 DK (nRF52840)
  * ST Nucleo L496ZG
  * ST Nucleo F413ZH
  * ST Nucleo F767ZI
  * NXP MIMXRT1170-EVKB (CM7)
  * NXP MIMXRT1060-EVK
  * NXP MIMXRT1010-EVK

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

* PROJECT UPDATE to `Zephyr Project`_ v3.6

Build Infrastructure
====================

Take over the new build principles from Zephyr:

* Use the new upstream *MIPI DBI API* for all *ILI9xxx* based displays.
* Take over upstream ``ci/check_compliance.py`` from Zephyr, adapt with all
  the needs for Bridle and extend support for
  :external+zephyr:ref:`external module roots <modules>` as defined by Zephyr
  module settings (``MODULE_EXT_ROOT``).
* Use new ``ci/check_compliance.py`` on GitHub workflow *QA Compliance Check*
  to do following with each PR:

  * Checks various nits in added/modified files, not coverd by other
    checks, e.g. checkpatch.pl and pylint.
  * Checks if Emails of author and signed-off messages are consistent.
  * Checks for conflict markers or whitespace errors.
  * Run Git, Python and YAML linting on the commits and find issues
    with style and syntax.
  * Check that MAINTAINERS file parses correctly.
  * Check that all modules have a MAINTAINERS entry.
  * Checks introducing any unwanted properties in Devicetree Bindings.
  * Checks introducing any new warnings/errors with Kconfig when no
    modules are available.
  * Checks introducing any new warnings/errors with Kconfig, the basic
    Kconfig test, which is checking only for undefined references.
  * Check for blocks of code or config that should be kept sorted.
  * Check that the diff contains no binary files that are not tollerated.
  * Check that any added image is limited in allowed size.

* Provide a `nix flake <https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes>`_ for reproducible
  development and build environments. The new nix flake definition, which
  provides as output a devshell, is now setup a development environment
  containing all necessary tools and libraries to work with Bridle. Really
  all dependencies, i.e. both system packages on the host and all necessary
  Python packages.

Documentation
=============

1. All scattered links to external resources and internal references to
   sections in the various docsets (e.g. Bridle or Zephyr) were moved to
   a central location in the files `links.txt` and `shortcuts.txt` and
   thus centralized.
2. Clarification that the Zephyr SDK will indeed be used and is the preferred
   default toolchain. All other references to the GNU toolchains by ARM Ltd.
   are entirely optional and may or may not be used.
3. Update all output messages in documentation to be in sync with the upcoming
   Bridle version v3.6.0, based on Zephyr v3.6 (samples and tests).
