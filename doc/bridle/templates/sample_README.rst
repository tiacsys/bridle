###############

.. note::

   Sections with character :sup:`*` on end of name are optional.

The XYZ sample application demonstrates how to work with X in the rhythm
of the Y that is played by Z.

.. tip::

   Explain what this example demonstrates in one, max two sentences (full
   sentences, not sentence fragments). You can go into more detail in the
   next section.

Overview
********

You can use this sample application as a starting point to implement
your own XYZ thing.

The sample applicaton uses the ``:ref:RST link`` library to control the X.
In addition, it uses the ``:ref:RST link`` Y access and hooks up to some
internet service to download cool Z sequences.

.. tip::

   Continue the explanation on what this example is about. What does it show,
   and why should users try it out? What is the practical use? How can users
   extend this example? What libraries are used? When linking, link to the
   conceptual documentation of other modules - these will in turn link to or
   contain the API documentation.

Some title\ :sup:`*`
====================

.. note::

   Add subsections for technical details. Give them a suitable title (sentence
   style capitalization, thus only the first word capitalized).

The sample application repeatedly calls function ABC, which ...

.. tip::

   Do not state what people can see and understand from looking at the code.
   Instead, clarify general concepts or explain parts of the implementation
   that might be unintuitive for some reason. If there's nothing important
   to point out, do not include any subsections.

Requirements
************

* One of the following development boards:

  * |zephyr:board:nucleo_f746zg| (NUCLEO-F746ZG)

* A Y account.
* A Z ball.

.. tip::

   Unless the sample is meant to go upstream, require a specific board, not
   "any board with Ethernet". Be specific - "any Ethernet board" will also
   mean all boards with Ethernet, but without LED power drivers ... When
   listing the supported boards, give both the name (ST Nucleo F746ZG board)
   and the board number (NUCLEO-F746ZG).

Wiring\ :sup:`*`
****************

Connect PIN1 to PIN2, then cut the connection again.

User interface\ :sup:`*`
************************

Button 1:
   Start or stop the XYZ show.

.. tip::

   Add Button and LED assignments here, plus other information related to the
   user interface.

Building and Running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/XXX`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your board, test it by performing the
following steps:

#. Connect to the board with some tool.
#. UART settings.
#. Press a button on the board.
#. Look at the flashing lights.
#. And so on ...

Sample output\ :sup:`*`
=======================

The following output is logged on [UART console|RTT]::

   whatever

Troubleshooting\ :sup:`*`
=========================

If the X do not start working with Y, check if the Z is valid enough.

Dependencies\ :sup:`*`
**********************

This sample uses the following |BRIDLE| libraries:

* :ref:`customservice_readme`

In addition, it uses the following Zephyr libraries:

* ``include/console.h``
* :external+zephyr:ref:`kernel_api`:

  * ``include/kernel.h``

.. tip::

   If possible, link to the respective library. If there is no documentation
   for the library, include the path.

Known issues and limitations\ :sup:`*`
**************************************

The sample only works with good Z.

References\ :sup:`*`
********************

* Z chapter in the Ethernet Spec (-> always link)
* Z ball datasheet

.. tip::

   Do not include links to documents that are common to all or many of samples.
   For example, the Ethernet Spec or the DK user guides are always important,
   but shouldn't be listed. Include specific links, like a chapter in the
   Ethernet Spec if the sample demonstrates the respective feature, or a link
   to the hardware pictures in the DK user guide if there is a lot of wiring
   required, or specific information about the feature that is presented in
   the sample.
