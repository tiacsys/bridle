|BRIDLE| plans to following
:zephyr:ref:`Zephyr's release scheduling <release_process>` that is currently
updates approximately every three-months. As long as there is no reason to do
other |BRIDLE| takes over Zephyr's version number, but try to reflect it on
the `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0`_ scheme. See the release notes below for
information about specific |BRIDLE| releases.
