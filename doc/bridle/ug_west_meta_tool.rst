West (Zephyrâ€™s meta-tool)
#########################

In European tradition, a |zephyr|_ is a light wind or a |west wind|_, named
after |Zephyrus|_, the Greek god or personification of the west wind. Don't
worry, this is not going to be a lesson in Greek methodology. Rather, it is
an attempt to find a "possible" explanation why the |ZEPHYR| in so many cases
refers to and relies on a small, inconspicuous but essential meta-tool called
``west``\ [#west-repo]_. What this meta-tool is capable of doing can be read
in detail at section :external+zephyr:ref:`west <west>` in the |ZEPHYR|
documentation.
