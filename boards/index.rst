The |BRIDLE| project developers are continually adding board-specific support as
documented below. If you are looking to add |BRIDLE| support for a new board,
please start with the upstream Zephyr :external+zephyr:ref:`board_porting_guide`.
To add support documentation for a new board, please use the template available
under :zephyr_file:`doc/templates/board.tmpl`

Supported Extensions
####################

Boards already supported by Zephyr or other Zephyr modules can be extended
by downstream users. In some situations, certain hardware description or
:external+zephyr:ref:`choices <devicetree-chosen-nodes>` can not be added
in the upstream Zephyr repository, but they can be in a downstream project,
where custom bindings or driver classes can also be created. For more details
about board extensions read the upstream Zephyr
:external+zephyr:ref:`board_porting_guide`, section about **Board extensions**.
